## Welcome to Huiting's code repository 👋

**DDS2M**  https://github.com/AvailableUsernameA/DDS2M   
1.Applied DDS2M denoising diffusion model to hyperspectral image restoration, enhancing generalization and noise robustness on unseen datasets   
2.Modified DDS2M to support batch processing of multiple images and adapted it for 3D hyperspectral data  
3.Conducted 3D image experiments and evaluated results using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)  

**ImageClassification** https://github.com/AvailableUsernameA/ImageClassification  
1. Developed PyTorch-based image classification system for automated quality inspection  (97% accuracy on validation set)  
2. The program was deployed in a factory in Beijing.  

**PeronaMalik**  https://github.com/AvailableUsernameA/PeronaMalik   
This was a personal project, and I'm pleased that it significantly improved the lab's image processing efficiency.  
1.Rewrote pixel-wise Python loops into NumPy matrix operations, reducing per-iteration complexity from O(N2) to O(N). Achieved ~6× runtime speedup  
2.integrated into Prof. Ay’s lab pipeline for daily biomedical image denoising.
